# sgd

sgd is an R package for large
scale estimation. It features many stochastic gradient methods, built-in models,
visualization tools, automated hyperparameter tuning, model checking, interval
estimation, and convergence diagnostics.

## Features
At the core of the package is the function
```{R}
sgd(formula, data, model, model.control, sgd.control)
```
It estimates parameters for a given data set and model using stochastic gradient
descent. The optional arguments `model.control` and `sgd.control` specify
attributes about the model and stochastic gradient method. Taking advantage of
the bigmemory package, sgd also operates on data sets which are too large to fit
in RAM as well as streaming data.

Example of large-scale linear regression:
```{R}
library(sgd)

# Dimensions
N <- 1e5  # number of data points
d <- 1e2  # number of features

# Generate data.
X <- matrix(rnorm(N*d), ncol=d)
theta <- rep(5, d+1)
eps <- rnorm(N)
y <- cbind(1, X) %*% theta + eps
dat <- data.frame(y=y, x=X)

sgd.theta <- sgd(y ~ ., data=dat, model="lm")
```

Any loss function may be specified. For convenience the following are
built-in:
* Linear models
* Generalized linear models
* Method of moments
* Generalized method of moments
* Cox proportional hazards model
* M-estimation

The following stochastic gradient methods exist:
* (Standard) stochastic gradient descent
* Implicit stochastic gradient descent
* Averaged stochastic gradient descent
* Averaged implicit stochastic gradient descent
* Classical momentum
* Nesterov's accelerated gradient

Check out the vignette in [`vignettes/`](vignettes/) or examples in [`demo/`](demo/).
In R, the equivalent commands are `vignette(package="sgd")` and
`demo(package="sgd")`.
