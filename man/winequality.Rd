\description{
This dataset is a collection of white "Vinho Verde" wine
samples from the north of Portugal. Due to privacy and logistic
issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output)
variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types,
wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
